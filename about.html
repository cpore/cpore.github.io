## About
--------
I am a Humanoid inhabitant of the planet Earth, who has too many hobbies and not enough time. A constant among these hobbies
is my affinity for all things computer-related. As such, I have accumulated a depth of knowledge and experience in the discipline of
Computer Science and programming which has naturally parlayed itself into a career as a Software Engineer.

I've done some pretty cool
stuff! As a Software Engineer, I have driven the design, development, and deployment of several large projects including
 a suite of server microservices, and an advanced
[Android Application.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hp.hpscanandcapture)
As a student, I've written an AI [Scrabble Agent](https://github.com/cpore/scrabble/blob/master/docs/report/scrabble.pdf) that would beat the pants off you,
used [big data to teach a computer how to identify kitties](https://github.com/cpore/omfgkitty/blob/master/docs/CS535%20TP%20Presentation.pdf),
built a [ray tracer](https://github.com/cpore/raytracer) from scratch (do you even vector, bro?),
and implemented a [compiler](https://github.com/cpore/java-atmel-compiler) that compiles a Java-like grammar to Atmel assembly.

I'm a vocal proponent of [Free/Libre and Open Source Software](https://www.fsf.org/).
Ocassionally, you can catch me atop my soapbox proselytizing the cause.
I'm also an expert at factoring large primes.
I currently reside in Fort Collins, Colorado, nestled in the foothills of the eastern
slope of the great Rocky Mountains where I work as a Senior Software Engineer for Criterion Systems, Inc.
