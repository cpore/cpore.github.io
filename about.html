## About
--------
I am a Human resident of the planet Earth, who has too many hobbies and not enough time. A constant among these hobbies
is my affinity for all things Computer-related. As such, I have accumulated a depth of knowledge and experience in the discipline of 
Computer Science and programming which has naturally parlayed itself into a career as a Software Engineer.
I'm a vocal advocate of [Free/Libre and Open Source Software](https://www.fsf.org/).
Ocassionally, you can catch me on my soapbox proselytizing the cause.
I currently reside in Fort Collins, nested among the foothills of the eastern
slope in the great state of Colorado where I work as Software Engineer for HP Inc.
I'm also an expert at factoring large primes.
